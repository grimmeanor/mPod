Portable music player with scroll wheel navigation and wired or wireless speaker connectivity

It's the 2020's and the iPod has gone the way of the dodo bird. But some of
us really want their iPod, or SoMeThInG exactly like an iPod. This is not
that SoMeThInG. But I did try to make something nice for a one-off, homemade,
side project with whatever tinkering, programming, electronics, and 3-D
modeling and assembly skills I may (or may not) have. Enjoy.
